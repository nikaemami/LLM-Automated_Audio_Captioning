387	 The sound of a diesel train passing by is a common sound in many parts of the world. It is often accompanied by the sound of the train's horn, which is used to alert people and other trains to the train's presence. The sound of the train's horn can vary depending on the type of train and the speed at which it is traveling. In some cases, the horn may be a continuous blast, while in other cases it may be a series of short blasts. The sound of the train's horn can also be affected by external factors, such as the terrain and the weather. For example, the horn may be louder or softer depending on whether the train is traveling through a tunnel or on an open stretch of track. Additionally, the sound of the horn may be affected by the temperature and humidity, as well as by the condition of the train's horn itself.

821	 The sound of the engine is loud and constant, with occasional bursts of higher-pitched noise. It's difficult to make out any specific words or conversations, but the overall noise level is quite high. It's possible that the plane is taking off or landing, or perhaps it's just flying at a high altitude. The sound is somewhat muffled, as if there is some sort of barrier between the microphone and the source of the sound. Despite the noise, it's clear that the engine is running at a high RPM and is producing a significant amount of power. The sound is also somewhat distorted, which may be due to the high volume or the presence of other sounds in the environment. Overall, the sound of the engine is intense and overwhelming, making it difficult to hear anything else.
